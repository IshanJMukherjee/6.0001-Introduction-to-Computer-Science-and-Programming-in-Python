# Problem sets solutions and notes for [6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Fall 2016](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016) on MIT OCW

Programming background before taking this course: [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

I've only written stuff that was interesting/new to me in the notes, so they are not comprehensive. Not everything in the notes is from the lectures (though most of it is). I also only started noting things lecture 4 onwards; earlier material was mostly completely familiar to me.

As of now, I still haven't gotten aroud to completing pset 5.
